# Simple CQRS

This is a sample application implemented using a CQRS event sourcing architecture.

This project is inspired by [Greg Young's simple CQRS example](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r) and is meant to be a showcase of the pattern envisioned by Greg Young implemented with modern .NET technologies. If you want a refresh of the theory behind the event sourcing architecture take a look at [this document](https://cqrs.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/cqrs_documents.pdf).
